# RUnlocker

This program finds the newest Roblox version on your pc, creates a ClientSettings folder, then creates a ClientAppSettings.json file inside of that folder.

It will ask you to enter your desired FPS value when you run it. Just type in a number, press enter, and that's it. It handles the rest by appending your desired FPS value to the JSON file

Anytime you'd like to change the FPS value, just run the program again like you did the first time.
